# Automatic Report 

This is an example of a automatic report sent via e-mail. 

Suppose you need to get some information at the internet and send a report to a coworker everyday, this is what this JupyterNotebook does. 

At this example it will be searched on the internet the updated prices of a fictional cryptocurrency wallet and made a Power Bi report, sent via e-mail as a PDF File. 

At this JupyterNotebook it's going to be used some well known libraries as Selenium, Pandas, Pyautogui and Win32com. 

Hope you enjoy it!
